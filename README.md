## Overview

The Concurrent Web Crawler is a Go-based application that efficiently crawls web pages. By leveraging Go's concurrency features, this tool provides fast and effective web scraping. Whether you want to gather data or analyze web content, this crawler is designed for performance and reliability.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Utilize Go's goroutines for fast processing.
- **Rate Limiting**: Control the number of requests sent to avoid overwhelming servers.
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to manage failures during crawling.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extract meaningful data from web pages.
- **Channel-Based Communication**: Efficient data flow and management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LOKESH-loky/Concurrent-Web-Crawler.git
   cd Concurrent-Web-Crawler
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o webcrawler
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./webcrawler
   ```

### Configuration

The application supports various configuration options. You can adjust the following parameters in the `config.yaml` file:

- `maxDepth`: Set the maximum depth for crawling.
- `maxUrls`: Limit the number of URLs to visit.
- `rateLimit`: Control the number of requests per second.

Example configuration:
```yaml
maxDepth: 3
maxUrls: 100
rateLimit: 10
```

### Running the Crawler

To start crawling, run the command:
```bash
./webcrawler -url <start_url>
```
Replace `<start_url>` with the target URL you want to crawl.

### Output

The crawler outputs the results in a structured format. You can specify the output format using command-line flags:
- `-json`: Outputs in JSON format.
- `-csv`: Outputs in CSV format.

### Example

```bash
./webcrawler -url https://example.com -json
```

## Advanced Usage

### Concurrency Control

The crawler allows you to control the number of concurrent requests. This is managed through the `concurrency` parameter in the command line:
```bash
./webcrawler -url https://example.com -concurrency 5
```
Adjust this number based on the target server's capabilities and your needs.

### Custom User Agent

To avoid blocking, set a custom User-Agent in the `config.yaml`:
```yaml
userAgent: "MyCustomCrawler/1.0"
```

## Error Handling

The crawler includes built-in error handling. It will log errors and continue processing remaining URLs. You can find logs in the `logs` directory.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
go test ./...
```
Make sure to review and run tests before deploying.
